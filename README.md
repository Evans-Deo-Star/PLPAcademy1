Fun Calculator 🧮

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** – a playful and beginner-friendly Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations like a boss! 😎 Whether you're just starting out with coding or want a light-hearted tool to crunch numbers, this mini-calculator has got your back.  

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ User-friendly number input
- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖️ Multiplication
- ➗ Division (assuming no division by zero for now 😅)

## 📋 How It Works

1. The program prompts you to enter two numbers (decimals allowed!).
2. It calculates:
   - The **sum**
   - The **difference**
   - The **product**
   - The **quotient**
3. It then prints out all the results in a fun, readable format.
